[Deployed on Heroku](https://guarded-plateau-69499.herokuapp.com/)

A full-stack bulletin board-themed task app. The Node package `Handlebars.js` used here allows HTML to be rendered server-side, reducing computation done client-side and potentially improving load-speeds in larger applications.

### Node Dependencies
```
* mySQL2
* Sequelize
* Express.js
* Handlebars.js
* Body-parser
```
